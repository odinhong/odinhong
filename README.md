## Hi ðŸ‘‹
I began coding as a hobby, building small tools like form fillers and auto-clickers to automate repetitive tasks and improve efficiency in my daily work. As my interest in software development grew, I took on more ambitious projects to deepen my skills.

This year, I completed two major projects:

- Financials Scraper (Go): A tool that scrapes and parses financial statements to create comprehensive master financial reports for public companies, consolidating every line item across reporting periods.
- Teller Manual (React): A web application that revolutionized workplace efficiency by providing bank tellers instant access to transaction procedures. This reduced training time, enabled independent work from day one, and minimized the need for senior staff guidance on routine transactions.

Seeing the tangible impact of my work on others motivated me to pursue software engineering as a career. I'm excited to contribute full-time, leveraging my problem-solving mindset and technical skills to create innovative solutions.
